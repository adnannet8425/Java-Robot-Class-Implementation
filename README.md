# Java-Robot-Class-Implementation
By Using Robot Class Of Java, I have automated some daily task like is there any task which you are doing every time when you started your computer or laptop, For example in windows there is common task which people does that is refreshing the Desktop so generally we are doing by right click and click on the refresh and we are doing this thing again again for no of times so by use of Robot class you just have to execute one Java file this will automatically done refresh, i have done this thing in a better way that is i have created batch file in which i have written command to execute that file.so i just whenever i boot my windows i am click on that batch file it will automatically done all these thing for me, you can use this method to do daily task for your Desktop or laptop
